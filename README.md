Design Best Practices
---------------------

1. Consistency with Design Pattern
   1. Same problem - Same Solution (with minimal modification od code)
   2. Benefits:
      * Reducing the errors
      * Increasing the error detection
      * Cost savings
   3. Ways to forcing consistency
      * Creating a software architecture and stick to it - identifying a pattern to be used throughout software consistently
      * Frameworks - A collection of design patterns to achieve specific goals
2. Programmers' mindset
   1. Completeness vs Correctness
      * Completeness - how much of what is required
        - Design Pattern - intentionally under defined
        - Baseline requirement
        - Potential customization and extension
      * Correctness
        - correctness of result
        - quality of the software
   2. Coupling vs Cohesion
      * Coupling - how many elements of the software are related (less desirable)
      * Cohesive - how independent the software components are (more desirable)
   3. Simplicity and Generality trade-offs
      * Design pattern should be simple enough to be quickly mastered and highly usable for practitioners
      * However, it should be general enough for reusability purposes
